Thanks again for letting me take a swing at this challenge! 

Here are some quick instructions on how to run the tests:

1. Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
2. Install Protractor from Terminal: "npm install -g protractor" (you may need to use the "sudo" prefix for this)
3. Make sure Selenium WebDriver is up to date: "(sudo) webdriver-manager update"
4. Start the Selenium server: "webdriver-manager start"
5. Navigate to the "specs" directory in the "rmchallenge" directory
6. Run Protractor from Terminal: "protractor conf.js"

Happy testing!
